# TaskManager

**TaskManager** is a full-stack task management web application built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** on the backend and **React.js** on the frontend. The project supports both personal and group-based task management with an accessible and responsive user interface.

This application was developed for an application development course project and showcases core CRUD functionality, dynamic filtering, and visual task representation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Backend (Django + DRF)

1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
